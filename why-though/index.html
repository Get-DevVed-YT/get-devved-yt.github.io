<span>Dec. 3, 2020; Why Though? How you are reading this webpage.</span>
<p>You're reading a web page currently. Probably on a phone or a computer.
But why? And how?
How are you reading this very page?
Let's delve into the deep wide world of the Internet.
Let's start way at the bottom:
<strong>What is the Internet?</strong>
You'd probably say you know, but you're definition, especially if you're not really techy, is different from what it is.
What we know today as the "Internet" is a group of servers with protocols, number groups and names given by the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) each with documents that make up websites.
Obviously, it's more complicated than that.
When you want to go to google.com, you type "www.google.com" into your search bar.
But what actually happens when you do this?
Well, first your browser tries to access the DNS (Domain Name System) and find any IP addresses related to the domain name.
If it finds it, it takes you to the site.
If it doesn't, it sends and error.
I could break it down more, but it wouldn't be really fun.
Ok, go to a new tab right now, and type this in the search bar: http://216.58.193.78
Click enter.
Where do you end up?
Is it Google?
The reason this random string of numbers took you to Google is because this is Google's IP address.
When your browser checked for the IP addresses associated with the name "google.com", it found the IP address 216.58.193.78 associated, and took you to that site.
Wanna know something interesting however?
Everyone has an IP address.
As long as you use the Internet via an ISP, you have an IP address.
Let me explain.
IP addresses are basically your Internet ID.
If you have a website, your probably going to have a domain for your IP so people can find your site easier.
Considering you have a website.
But IP addresses are still your official Internet ID, and is stored in ICANN.
You're IP is also used for delivering you Internet content.
However, the scary thing is that if someone got a hold of your IP, they could track your location, ISP, and more.
How?
Well, there are ways people can reverse search your IP and find the host server.
For sites like Google and other big sites, this isn't really a problem.
It becomes a problem for just common Internet users.
Here's a word of advice: try your hardest NEVER to give your IP to anyone. They can do malicious things with it. 
There is one exception: VPNs.
I won't go to into depth how VPNs work in this post, but maybe in another one.
But basically, they provide you with a "mask" for your IP. 
So people may think your from a different place from where you actually live.
They also encrypt your data, but not going too deep into that.
But anyway, want to know something interesting?
You can actually set up a web server on your own computer!
You have an IP, so you can set one up under it. Maybe get yourself a domain to mask it.
But many people are lazy to set one up, or just find other risks to it.
I was interested in the idea of setting up a web server to host a website which was, and is, a passion project for me (it's not this one).
But I realized that setting these up can, and will, have many problems.
Maybe in the future, I may actually look into it.
Plus, domains cost money.
Anyway, I decided to make a website that would be sort of like a blog for my YouTube Channel and other stuff.
I knew that GitHub had a free hosting service, as I had used Github Pages before this website.
So I decided to make this thing. 
It was on GitHub's IP address and servers, because I'm not hosting it.
You've probably come to this website through many ways:
Maybe someone linked it to you, you found this in the blog archive, you were randomly checking the Internet,
links bounce around often.
But either way, I'm glad you read this. Now, you are a little more educated in how the Internet works
